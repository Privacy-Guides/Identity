## Why your data matters

Imagine this: You sign up for a free app, and suddenly you're getting oddly specific ads — like for a specific sunscreen you mentioned in passing last week. It's not a coincidence. That free app? It’s quietly selling insights about you to the highest bidder.

📢 **Your data has value. Not just to hackers, but to advertisers, insurers, data brokers — even political campaigners.**

And while you may never see a cent from it, the companies collecting it are raking in billions.

## How much is your data worth?

This depends on **who you are**, **what you do**, and **who’s buying**. Here's a rough breakdown from [Proton's research](https://proton.me/blog/what-is-your-data-worth):

| **Type of Data**         | **Estimated Value** |
|--------------------------|---------------------|
| Basic identity info (name, email, DOB) | $1–$10         |
| Full medical record      | $250–$1,000         |
| Credit card number       | $5–$110             |
| Social media profile     | $5–$50              |
| Full identity bundle (tax file number, address, phone, etc.) | $1000+ |

⚠️ On the dark web, prices fluctuate — but to the **legit data broker industry**, each user might be worth **$240+ per year**, according to studies.

## So… who's profiting off me?

You're probably already in the database of dozens of **data brokers** — companies whose entire business is collecting, bundling, and selling personal data.

**These might include:**
- Marketing agencies
- Credit reporting agencies
- Loyalty card programs
- Social media platforms
- App developers
- Insurers and real estate platforms

> 🧠 **Example**: That “free” fitness app you downloaded may be selling your workout times and sleep habits to health insurers.

## Callout: Data brokers in Australia

Australia isn’t immune. While we don’t have as many consumer-facing data brokers, **credit reporting agencies like Equifax and illion**, or marketing firms like **Quantium**, trade in Aussie data daily. And our **Privacy Act is overdue for reform**.

> 💡 **Tip**: You can request a free copy of your credit report from [Equifax](https://www.equifax.com.au/personal/products/my-credit-file), [illion](https://www.illion.com.au/consumer-credit-file/), or [Experian](https://www.experian.com.au/consumer/credit-report).

## Why this matters

- **You could be discriminated against.** Insurance premiums, job offers, even dating matches can be affected by data you didn’t know was shared.
- **You’re more vulnerable to scams.** The more info floating around, the easier it is to impersonate you.
- **You’re helping build invasive profiles.** Even if you’re “boring,” your data helps build a model that targets others.

✅ **Checklist: Quick wins to protect your data**
- [ ] Use a browser extension like **uBlock Origin** or **Privacy Badger**
- [ ] Disable ad/tracker permissions in your phone and browser
- [ ] Use **email alias tools** like [SimpleLogin](https://simplelogin.io/) or [Firefox Relay](https://relay.firefox.com/)
- [ ] Avoid unnecessary loyalty cards and “free” services
- [ ] Check your credit report annually
