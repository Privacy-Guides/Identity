## Why remove your data?

You might not realise it, but your personal info is already floating around — collected, bought, and sold by **data brokers**. These companies quietly scrape, buy, and aggregate everything from your **name, age, email**, and **address**, to your **job title**, **family connections**, **shopping habits**, and more.

Removing your data helps:
- Reduce your risk of identity theft and scams
- Cut down on spam and unsolicited calls
- Regain a little digital dignity

## What is a data broker?

A data broker is a company that **collects, packages, and sells personal data** — often without your consent.

📦 **They get info from:**
- Public records (like electoral rolls)
- Social media
- Loyalty programs
- Online purchases
- Surveys and competitions
- Real estate and job search sites

🎯 **They sell it to:**
- Advertisers
- Insurers
- Political campaigners
- Other brokers
- Even cybercriminals (indirectly)

## Examples of data brokers (AU & Global)

Here’s a mix of Australian and international services to be aware of:

| **Broker**         | **Based in** | **Opt-Out Option** |
|--------------------|--------------|---------------------|
| Equifax            | Australia    | ✅ [Opt out](https://www.equifax.com.au/contact-us/credit-report-dispute-form) |
| illion             | Australia    | ✅ [Opt out](https://www.illion.com.au/contact-us/) |
| Experian           | Australia    | ✅ [Opt out](https://www.experian.com.au/consumer/credit-report) |
| Whitepages         | Australia    | ✅ [Unlist](https://www.whitepages.com.au/unlisted-numbers) |
| BeenVerified       | USA          | ✅ [Opt out](https://www.beenverified.com/app/optout/search) |
| PeopleFinders      | USA          | ✅ [Opt out](https://www.peoplefinders.com/manage/) |
| Spokeo             | USA          | ✅ [Opt out](https://www.spokeo.com/opt_out/new) |

📝 **Note**: Not all of these brokers will have your data, but many do. Best to check and request removal just in case.

## Callout: There's no one-click fix

Unfortunately, there’s no central “delete my data” button. Each broker has its own opt-out process, and some make it *deliberately annoying*.

💡 **Good news**: You can use services like:
- [DeleteMe](https://joindeleteme.com) (US-focused, but improving)
- [Privacy Bee](https://privacybee.com) *(check AU support)*
- Or do it yourself using checklists like this 👇

## ✅ DIY Checklist: How to start cleaning up

Use this as a recurring task every 6–12 months.

- [ ] Google yourself — search your name, email, phone number
- [ ] Check Whitepages and request unlisting
- [ ] Download your credit report (Equifax, illion, Experian) and request corrections/removals
- [ ] Opt out of known US brokers like BeenVerified and Spokeo
- [ ] Set up email aliases using [SimpleLogin](https://simplelogin.io) or [Firefox Relay](https://relay.firefox.com)
- [ ] Remove old accounts using [JustDelete.me](https://justdeleteme.xyz/)
- [ ] Install **uBlock Origin** or **Privacy Badger** to limit future data leakage
- [ ] Limit permissions on apps and browsers (location, contacts, etc.)
- [ ] Regularly clear cookies and use incognito/private browsing

## A quick story: The giveaway giveaway

Tom entered a local giveaway for a “$100 Coles gift card.” He didn’t win — but he *did* start getting daily calls from overseas call centres. Turns out, the competition site sold his info to a third-party data broker.

> 📵 Always read the T&Cs (or use an alias email) for competitions, giveaways, and sign-ups.

## Don’t forget the basics

🔐 **Bonus Tip**: Deleting data is one part. **Locking down future exposure** is just as important.

- Use a **password manager** (e.g. 1Password, Bitwarden)
- Enable **MFA** on every important account
- Avoid using the same email for everything — create separate emails for shopping, banking, socials

---

## TL;DR

Data brokers profit from *your* personal info — but you can fight back. It’s a bit of admin work, but worth it for your privacy and peace of mind.
